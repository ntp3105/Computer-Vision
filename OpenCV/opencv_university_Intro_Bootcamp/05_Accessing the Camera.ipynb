    "This notebook describes a simple code on how to access the camera attached to the computer system and send that streaming video to an output window on the display.\n",
    "First import the OpenCV and the systems module both of which are required below. Then specify a default camera device index of zero. Then simply check to see if there was a command line specification to override that default value but in this case, just going to use zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then call the video capture class to create a video capture object and we pass in device index into that class. Device index of zero will access the default camera on your system. If you had more than one camera attached to your system then you would need to indicate a device index that points to the correct one. So zero would be the default, one would be the second camera, two would be the third camera and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then create a named window which we're going to eventually send the streamed output to and create a while loop. This while loop is going to allow us to continuously stream video from the camera and send it to the output unless the user hits the Escape key. So that's what this wait key function does, it continuously checks whether or not the users hit the Escape key. The first line in this Loop uses that video capture object source to call the read method in that class and that read method will return a single frame from the video stream as well as a logical variable has underscore frame. If there's any kind of a problem with reading the video stream or accessing the camera then has frame would be false and we would break from the loop. Otherwise we'd continue on and call the \"imshow\" function in OpenCV to actually send the video frame to the output window.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that's all there is to it, there's not much code we just wanted to walk through that and give an example of how to do this. So let's go ahead and execute it. And there it is, here's the window streaming video from my web camera right to the display. As soon as I hit the Escape key this is going to exit. That's all.\n"
