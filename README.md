Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence and computer science that focuses on enabling computers to interpret and understand visual information from the real world. It involves developing algorithms and techniques that allow computers to analyze and process digital images and videos, extract meaningful insights, and make decisions based on visual input.

Key aspects of computer vision include:

1. **Image Processing**: Manipulating and enhancing digital images to extract useful information or to improve their quality. This may involve techniques such as filtering, edge detection, and feature extraction.

2. **Object Detection and Recognition**: Identifying and localizing objects within an image or video stream. This can range from simple tasks such as detecting faces or text to more complex tasks such as recognizing specific objects or scenes.

3. **Image Classification**: Categorizing images into predefined classes or categories based on their visual content. This is commonly used in applications such as content-based image retrieval and automatic image tagging.

4. **Semantic Segmentation**: Partitioning an image into regions or segments and assigning semantic labels to each segment. This allows for fine-grained understanding of the contents of an image, such as identifying individual objects and their boundaries.

5. **3D Reconstruction**: Estimating the three-dimensional structure of objects or scenes from one or more images or video frames. This is useful for applications such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and robotics.

6. **Motion Analysis**: Analyzing the movement of objects or the camera itself within a video sequence. This includes tasks such as object tracking, optical flow estimation, and activity recognition.

Computer vision has a wide range of applications across various industries, including healthcare (medical image analysis), automotive (autonomous driving), surveillance and security, agriculture, retail, and entertainment. Advances in deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have significantly advanced the capabilities of computer vision systems, enabling them to achieve human-level performance on many visual recognition tasks.
